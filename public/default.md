Dear Sir, Madam, et al:

We are pleased to enter into business relationship with y'all. Please find enclosed the documents you requested which have been signed and executed as of this date. For now, let's table the outstanding issue with legal, in light of recent corporate restructurings which have affected Q6 goals for the near future.

In regards to business development, the outlook is strong. We are well-positioned to weather the struts of shifting industries, including the competitive advantage we now have with the recent mergers with our parent subsidiary, Chekov Gun Manufacturing Co. However, we forecast a 95% drop in operational efficiency in the deliverables growth sector, due to the passage of AR-451 legislation which severely restricts tax abatement to our shareholders.

I'm happy to double click the warm intro to our Chief Technology Official, should you prefer the alternative.

Yours truly,
